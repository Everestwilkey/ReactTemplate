# Overview

I created a front end for my website this was to demonstrate my abilities in creating a react front end using components state and routes in order to make a very simple website.

I wrote this for my own personal use but also as a demonstration of react to gain a better understanding of the complexity as well as how react actually works and to make better decisions in the future on what kind of front end I would like to use.

I learn a lot from how to use routs, hooks and components.

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
I use Vs Code as my IDE and added some extensions such as Prettier ReactSnippets. I also used packages like Vite for creating the react app Bootstrap for easy CSS and React-Routs for routing to different components.

I used React plus typescript to code all the components. I used typescript because I like the type safety and wanted to get use to the way it works for future project using typescript.

## List of Packages I used

- npm create vite@latest
- npm i bootstrap@5.3.3
- npm install bootstrap
