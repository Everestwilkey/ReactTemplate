# Overview

I created a front end for my website this was to demonstrate my abilities in creating a react front end using components state and routes in order to make a very simple website.

I wrote this for my own personal use but also as a demonstration of react to gain a better understanding of the complexity as well as how react actually works and to make better decisions in the future on what kind of front end I would like to use.
